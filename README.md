# Introduction to Pandas!

Hey there! If you're totally new using Pandas to analyze data, then this notebook is for you. I've done this incredible short course by reading the W3School Pandas course that I really recommend you. 

So, if you're a noob or if you're a Pro, this notebooks contains all basics topics likes setting a DataFrame, reading a CVS/JSON, or finding correlations in your data, so I think it's a good start by reading it and also it's a good notebook to review sometime.

# Why did I create this?
In my path to learn a little more about AI, you defitively must know a little about feature engineering, and the fundamental library to do this is Pandas, so, as I didn't want to save all this knowledge to myself, I prefer to create a notebook and share it with everybody!

# Licence
I don't really know what a License it's, but if you want to copy this, it's okay, as in Breaking Bad just "Say my name" and don't take all the credit.
